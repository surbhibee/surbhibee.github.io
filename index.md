Welcome to my [digital garden](tab:https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)[^1]. You likely arrived here through my [personal website](tab:https://surbhib.me/) so I will save you the spiel on photography, writing, data, and books, though all will reappear in forthcoming posts. I hope you enjoy what you find here. [Let me know](tab:https://twitter.com/_surbhib) if you have any thoughts!
